**Homework: 2**

Scope of the task: HTML | CSS

**Requirements to pass:**
`1` HTML tags for the Portfolio page are inserted in the portfolio.html file.

`2` HTML tags for all layout elements are implemented.

`3` Tags are used according to their semantic meaning.

`4` HTML is validated by the validator without errors.

`5` Class names are understandable to another programmer.

`6` Class names do not contain capital letters, spaces, transliterations, or tag names, only letters and English words. If a class name consists of multiple words, they are separated by hyphens.

`7` The href attribute of navigation links for Studio and Portfolio contains a relative path to the HTML files of those pages. Clicking the link navigates to the respective page in the current browser tab.

`8` `<img>` tags have dimension attributes, at least `width` and `height`.

`9` Images are exported from the layout in jpg format.

`10` Groups of elements of the same type are grouped in `<ul>` lists.

`11` The filter on the Portfolio page is created by a list of buttons, each with the `type="button"` attribute set.

`12` Header and footer tags are the same on all pages.

`13` All fonts and their variations required for the layout (thickness and style) are connected from Google Fonts using a single link. The required weight for Raleway is 800, and for Roboto, it's 400, 500, 700, and 900.

`14` There are no additional elements inside button tags, such as spans or links.

## Styling

`1` There are no global styles for elements other than `<body>`.

`2` Class selectors are used for styling.

`3` There are no `!important` in styles.

`4` Interactive elements (buttons and links) have an active state when hovered over with the mouse or focused with the keyboard, as indicated in the layout (color change).

`5` The contact text in the header and footer changes color when hovered over with the cursor and focused.

`6` CSS variables are used to store the color palette of the layout (text, background, highlight).

`7` The `<body>` element has a `font-family` property with the dominant Roboto font in the layout.

`8` Alternative font options and font family type (sans-serif) are specified at the end of the `font-family` list for the `<body>` element.

`9` The Roboto font family is explicitly defined only for the `<body>` element; other elements inherit it.

`10` The `<body>` element has a `color` property with the dominant text color in the layout. Other text inherits or overrides this value.

`11` The font size (`font-size` property) of all text elements exactly matches the values in the layout.

`12` The line height (`line-height` property) of all text elements exactly matches the values in the layout and is specified as a multiplier, not in pixels.

`13` The color (`color` property) of all text elements exactly matches the values in the layout.

`14` The font weight (`font-weight` property) of all text elements exactly matches the values in the layout.

`15` Font weight (`font-weight` property) is explicitly defined only when the value in the layout differs from the browser's default for that element.

`16` Buttons have a `cursor` property with the value `pointer`.

`17` Default property values set by the browser are not repeated in styles. For example, links do not need `cursor: pointer`, and paragraphs do not need `font-style: normal` or `font-weight: 400`.
